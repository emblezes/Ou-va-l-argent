# FACT-CHECK: Pension Systems - Capitalization vs Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG)

**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Subject:** Global pension systems classification - Funded (capitalization) vs PAYG (répartition)
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED with nuances

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Key Finding:** Most countries operate MIXED pension systems combining PAYG and funded components. Pure systems are rare.

**Verification Confidence:** HIGH (based on OECD Pensions at a Glance 2025, World Bank data, official government sources)

**Critical Nuances:**
- The majority of OECD countries combine PAYG first-pillar pensions with funded second/third pillars
- "Mandatory funded" systems exist in 19 of 38 OECD countries (2024)
- Even Chile's "pure capitalization" system underwent major reform in 2025, becoming mixed
- Classification depends on which pillar is DOMINANT in terms of replacement rate and coverage

---

## CLASSIFICATION BY COUNTRY

### Group A: Mandatory Funded Systems (Capitalization Dominant)

#### 1. **CHILE** 🔴 NO LONGER PURELY CAPITALIZATION

**Historical System (1981-2025):**
- Pure individual capitalization system with private AFPs (Pension Fund Administrators)
- World's first fully privatized mandatory pension system

**MAJOR REFORM 2025:**
- Law 21,735 published March 26, 2025
- Creates NEW MIXED SYSTEM combining:
  - Individual capitalization accounts (AFPs) - 4.5 percentage points of increased contributions
  - Social Security Pension Insurance (SSPI) - new collective component
- Mandatory employer contribution increased by 1% over 9-11 years
- Generational funds replace multi-fund choice system (A-E)
- Bidding system: 10% of affiliates reassigned to lowest-commission AFP every 2 years

**Verdict:** ❌ NO LONGER PURE CAPITALIZATION (as of 2025)

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. CHILE IS NO LONGER PURELY CAPITALIZATION ❌

**Critical Update:** As of March 2025, Chile's pension system is now MIXED, combining individual capitalization (AFPs) with a new Social Security Pension Insurance (SSPI) component. The claim that "Chile has a pure capitalization system" is **OUTDATED**.

### 2. FRANCE IS PURELY PAYG (RÉPARTITION) ✅

**Confirmed:** France operates a pure pay-as-you-go system for both basic pensions AND supplementary pensions (AGIRC-ARRCO). The second pillar AGIRC-ARRCO is often misunderstood as funded, but it explicitly operates on a PAYG basis where current contributions immediately finance current retirees.

### 3. MOST COUNTRIES HAVE MIXED SYSTEMS ⚠️

**Key Insight:** The binary classification "capitalization vs PAYG" is oversimplified. According to OECD Pensions at a Glance 2025:
- 19 of 38 OECD countries have mandatory or quasi-mandatory funded components
- Most combine PAYG first-pillar basic pensions with funded second/third pillars
- The trend is towards mixed systems rather than pure models

### 4. MANDATORY FUNDED PENSION COUNTRIES (Complete List)

**Confirmed Mandatory Funded Systems (2024-2025):**

**Pure or Dominant Funded:**
1. Singapore (CPF)
2. Australia (Superannuation)
3. Switzerland (BVG/LPP 2nd pillar)
4. Mexico (AFOREs)

**Quasi-Mandatory (90%+ coverage):**
5. Netherlands (occupational pensions)
6. Denmark (ATP + occupational)
7. Iceland (occupational pensions)
8. Finland (occupational pensions)

**Auto-Enrollment / Mixed:**
9. United Kingdom (NEST auto-enrollment)
10. Sweden (2.5% Premium Pension + occupational)

**Formerly Pure, Now Mixed:**
11. Chile (post-2025 reform)

**Other Countries with Mandatory DC Components:**
12-19. Various OECD countries with smaller mandatory funded pillars (Israel, Estonia, Lithuania, etc.)

### 5. NDC (NOTIONAL DEFINED CONTRIBUTION) SYSTEMS

**Countries Using NDC (PAYG but with DC-like features):**
- Italy (since 1990s reform)
- Latvia
- Norway
- Poland (ZUS)
- Sweden (first pillar)

**Important:** NDC systems are PAYG (no actual investment) but mimic funded DC systems through notional accounts. They should be classified as PAYG, not funded.

### 6. WORLD BANK THREE-PILLAR FRAMEWORK

**Historical Context:**
- World Bank's 1994 report "Averting the Old Age Crisis" promoted three-pillar systems
- Influenced 18+ countries to adopt funded mandatory second pillars
- Based on Chile's 1981 reform success
- Baltic states, Eastern Europe adopted model in 1990s-2000s
- Mixed results: some countries (Poland) reversed course, others (Netherlands, Denmark) succeeded

## FACT-CHECK VERDICTS

### Claim 1: "Chile has a pure capitalization pension system"
**Verdict:** ❌ FALSE (as of 2025)
**Correction:** Chile HAD a pure capitalization system (1981-2025) but implemented major reform in March 2025 creating a mixed system with both individual capitalization (AFPs) and Social Security Pension Insurance (SSPI).

### Claim 2: "France has a pure répartition (PAYG) system"
**Verdict:** ✅ TRUE
**Confirmation:** Both basic pensions and supplementary pensions (AGIRC-ARRCO) operate on pay-as-you-go basis. Funded components are minimal (voluntary third pillar only).

### Claim 3: "Australia has mandatory private pension savings"
**Verdict:** ✅ TRUE
**Confirmation:** Superannuation Guarantee is mandatory at 12% (2025), managed by private fund managers, paid by employers.

### Claim 4: "Singapore CPF is a mandatory funded system"
**Verdict:** ✅ TRUE
**Confirmation:** CPF is compulsory savings scheme with individual accounts, fully funded, no PAYG component.

### Claim 5: "Netherlands has a mandatory funded second pillar"
**Verdict:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY TRUE (quasi-mandatory)
**Nuance:** Not legally mandatory for all, but 90%+ coverage through collective labor agreements makes it effectively mandatory. Correctly classified as "quasi-mandatory."

### Claim 6: "Most developed countries are moving away from PAYG to funded systems"
**Verdict:** ⚠️ MIXED / NUANCED
**Reality:** The trend is towards MIXED systems, not pure funded systems. While funded components are growing in many countries (UK auto-enrollment, Netherlands expansion), pure PAYG systems (France, Germany, Spain) remain resistant to major structural reform. Some countries (Poland 2014) even moved away from funded systems.

## METHODOLOGY & SOURCES

### Primary Sources Used:
1. **OECD Pensions at a Glance 2025** - Latest comprehensive cross-country comparison
2. **OECD Pension Markets in Focus 2025** - Asset data and market analysis
3. **World Bank pension system frameworks** - Three/five-pillar classification
4. **Official government sources** - National pension authorities and ministries
5. **National pension fund reports** - CPF, ZUS, NPS, GPIF, etc.

### Source Reliability:
- ✅ **HIGH:** OECD publications, official government sources, national social security administrations
- ✅ **MEDIUM:** Academic journals, think tanks, major consultancies (KPMG, Lockton)
- ⚠️ **SUPPLEMENTARY:** Wikipedia (cross-referenced with primary sources), news articles

### Limitations:
1. **Complexity:** Most systems are mixed; "dominant pillar" classification requires judgment
2. **Recent reforms:** 2024-2025 changes may not be fully reflected in older sources
3. **Coverage vs mandate:** "Quasi-mandatory" systems blur the line between voluntary and mandatory
4. **Replacement rates:** Relative importance of pillars varies by income level

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONTENT CREATORS

### For Infographics:
1. **Avoid binary classifications** - Use "PAYG-dominant," "Funded-dominant," or "Mixed"
2. **Date-stamp claims** - Pension systems change frequently (Chile 2025 example)
3. **Distinguish mandatory vs quasi-mandatory** - Important for accuracy
4. **Note NDC systems separately** - They're PAYG but with DC-like features
5. **Include sources** - Always cite OECD, World Bank, or official government sources

### Key Messages:
- ✅ "Most countries combine PAYG and funded pensions in mixed systems"
- ✅ "France is one of the few remaining pure PAYG systems in developed countries"
- ✅ "Mandatory funded pensions exist in 19 OECD countries, with varying coverage"
- ❌ "Chile has a pure capitalization system" (OUTDATED as of 2025)
- ✅ "Australia and Singapore have the most developed mandatory funded systems"

**Key Takeaway for Content Creators:**

When discussing pension systems, **ALWAYS specify the date and distinguish between pure vs mixed systems**. The claim "Chile has capitalization, France has répartition" is oversimplified and partially outdated. The accurate statement is: "France operates a pure PAYG system, while Chile reformed from pure capitalization (1981-2025) to a mixed system in 2025. Most developed countries now combine PAYG and funded elements in hybrid systems."
